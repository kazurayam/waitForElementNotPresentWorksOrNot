= WebUI.waitForElementNotPresent keyword --- was it fixed at v8.6.0 or not?

== Problem to solve

In the Katalon User forum, there was a post
link:https://forum.katalon.com/t/katalon-studio-8-6-0-waitforelementnotpresent-bug-timeout/85476["Katalon Studio 8.6.0 - waitForElementNotPresent - bug - timeout"]. The original post reported that, at v8.6.0, link:https://docs.katalon.com/docs/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/web-ui-keywords/webui-wait-for-element-not-present[WebUI.waitForElementPresent] keyword failed to work. Later, @vu.tran reported that, at v8.6.5, link:https://forum.katalon.com/t/katalon-studio-8-6-0-waitforelementnotpresent-bug-timeout/85476/30[the bug was fixed]. However, link:https://forum.katalon.com/t/katalon-studio-8-6-0-waitforelementnotpresent-bug-timeout/85476/31[@qa113 wrote] that the bug still remains in v8.6.5.

The bug of waitForElementNotPresent keyword --- is it fixed at v8.6.5 or not?

== What I have done

I have developed a Katalon Studio project link:https://github.com/kazurayam/waitForElementNotPresentWorksOrNot[kazurayam/waitForElementNotPresentWorksOrNot]. With it, I examined how `WebUI.waitForElementNotPresent` keyword works in v8.4.1, v8.6.0 and v8.6.5.

=== How to download the project

You can download the zip of this project from the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/waitForElementNotPresentWorksOrNot/releases[Releases] page, unzip it, open it with your local Katalon Studio.

=== Application Under Test

You can see our Application Under Test at

- https://kazurayam.github.io/waitForElementNotPresentWorksOrNot/page.html

The page shows a Countdown clock. The clock has a countdown distance of 10 seconds as default.

Internally the HTML contains an P element with id="demo" as this:
```
<p id="demo">0d 0h 0m 8s</p>
```

When the countdown clock reaches zero, then the clock will disappear. A message "Gone!" comes up.

Internally, the `<p id="demo">0d 0h 0m Xs</p>` element will be removed (becomes not present) when the clock reached zero.

=== Test scripts

Please read the source codes for detail.

You can execute "`Test Suites/TS1`" which will execute "`Test Cases/TC1_d10_t7`" and "`Test Cases/TC2_d10_t13`" in this sequence. The `TS1` is enabled to take movies in MOV format. I converted the MOV movies to MP4, and posted them to YouTube.


=== Study

I developed a set of test scripts in Katalon Studio which employs the `WebUI.waitForElementNotPresent(TestObject, int timeout)` keyword.

The scripts uses 2 terms with special meaning. So let me define them.

- *distance* --- The countdown clock starts with the given distance (default=10), goes down by 1 second until it reaches 0.

- *timeout* --- The `WebUI.waitForElementNotPresent` keyword requires an integer as 2nd argument "timeout".

I have developed 2 cases of verification.

*Test Case 1* : The distance is 10 seconds, timeout is *7* seconds. The target HTML element "demo" will still be there in the page when the timeout expires. The clock will remain in the page view. In this case, the keyword should stop immediately after the timeout. The keyword should return `false` to the caller script.

*Test Case 2* : The distance is 10 seconds, timeout is *13* seconds. The target HTML element "demo" will disappear before the timeout expires. The clock will fade and a message "GONE" will comes up in the page view. In this case, __the keyword should stop immediately after the timeout__. The keyword should return `true` to the caller script.

==== Case where the HTML element is still present when the keyword gets timed out

==== Case where the HTML element disappears before the keyword gets timed out

===== v8.4.1

===== v8.6.0

===== v8.6.5

== Conclusion


Based on the findings in the examination, I would conclude that the link:https://forum.katalon.com/t/katalon-studio-8-6-0-waitforelementnotpresent-bug-timeout/85476[original problem] raised by @petr.brezina was really fixed at v8.6.5.
