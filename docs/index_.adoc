= WebUI.waitForElementNotPresent keyword --- was it fixed at v8.6.0 or not?

== Problem to solve

In the Katalon User forum, there was a post
link:https://forum.katalon.com/t/katalon-studio-8-6-0-waitforelementnotpresent-bug-timeout/85476["Katalon Studio 8.6.0 - waitForElementNotPresent - bug - timeout"]. The original post reported that, at v8.6.0, link:https://docs.katalon.com/docs/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/web-ui-keywords/webui-wait-for-element-not-present[WebUI.waitForElementPresent] keyword failed to work. Later, @vu.tran reported that, at v8.6.5, link:https://forum.katalon.com/t/katalon-studio-8-6-0-waitforelementnotpresent-bug-timeout/85476/30[the bug was fixed]. However, link:https://forum.katalon.com/t/katalon-studio-8-6-0-waitforelementnotpresent-bug-timeout/85476/31[@qa113 wrote] that the bug still remains in v8.6.5.

The bug of waitForElementNotPresent keyword --- is it fixed at v8.6.5 or not?

== Solution

I have developed a Katalon Studio project link:https://github.com/kazurayam/waitForElementNotPresentWorksOrNot[kazurayam/waitForElementNotPresentWorksOrNot]. With it, I examined how `WebUI.waitForElementNotPresent` keyword. How does the keyword works in v8.6.0 and in v8.6.5.

Based on the findings in the examination, I would conclude that the problem was already fixed at v8.6.5.

== Description

What was the original issue? How can I conclude the problem was fixed already? --- I will describe it as follows.


=== Download the project

You can download the zip of this project from the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/waitForElementNotPresentWorksOrNot/releases[Releases] page, unzip it, open it with your local Katalon Studio.

=== Application Under Test

You can see our Application Under Test at link:https://kazurayam.github.io/waitForElementNotPresentWorksOrNot/page.html[]

The page shows a Countdown clock. The clock has a countdown distance of 10 seconds as default.

Internally the HTML contains an P element with id="demo" as this:
```
<p id="demo">0d 0h 0m 8s</p>
```

When the countdown clock reaches zero, then the clock will disappear. A message "Gone!" comes up.

Internally, the `<p id="demo">0d 0h 0m Xs</p>` element will be removed (becomes not present) when the clock reached zero.
